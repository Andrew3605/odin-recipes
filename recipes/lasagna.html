<h4>how to make it</h4>
<p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers pasta, sauce, and cheese for a delicious meal. To make it, start by cooking one pound of ground beef in a pan until browned, then drain the excess fat. Mix the cooked meat with 24 ounces of marinara or tomato sauce and season it with salt, pepper, and Italian herbs to taste. In a separate pot, cook 12 lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, then drain and set them aside. In a bowl, combine 15 ounces of ricotta cheese with one egg and a little salt and pepper. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a baking dish, start by spreading a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Then, place a layer of noodles on top, followed by a layer of the ricotta mixture, a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese, and more meat sauce. Repeat these layers until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of mozzarella and some grated Parmesan on top. Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 20 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Let the lasagna rest for 10 minutes before serving so it holds together nicely.</p>
